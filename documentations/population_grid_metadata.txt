**Title:**  
U.S. 100m Population Grid (2020)

**Description:**  
This dataset provides a fine-resolution (100m × 100m) population raster for the contiguous United States, derived from the 2020 Decennial Census. The dataset disaggregates census population counts to grid cells, producing a uniform surface for spatial analysis and crosswalk creation.  

**Files:**  
- `*_grid100m_pop_2020_area.tif` – population raster for each state.

**Spatial coverage:**  
United States, 50 states.

**Temporal coverage:**  
2020.

**Variables:**  
- Raster cell value: population count per 100m × 100m cell.

**How to use:**  
- Overlay with geographic boundaries to estimate population shares.  
- Use as input for crosswalk creation.  
- Suitable for aggregation to arbitrary boundaries.
