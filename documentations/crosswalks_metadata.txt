**Title:**
Population-Weighted Crosswalks between 2020 Commuting Zones, PUMAs, and Historical Geographies (1990–2020)

**Description:**
This dataset provides population-weighted crosswalks between 2020 Commuting Zones (CZ20), 2020 PUMAs, and multiple historical and contemporary geographies. Available crosswalks include:

* CZ20 → 1990 commuting zones (CZ90)
* CZ20 → 2000 and 2010 ERS commuting zones
* 2010 & 2020 PUMAs → CZ20
* 2020 PUMAs → CZ90

Crosswalks were constructed using a 100m population raster derived from the 2020 Census. Each record reports population overlap, shares, and totals that allow consistent reallocation of data between geographies.

**Files:**

* `cz20_to_cz90_popgrid100m_area.csv` – CZ20 → CZ90
* `cz20_to_cz2010_popgrid100m_area.csv` – CZ20 → CZ2010
* `cz20_to_cz2000_popgrid100m_area.csv` – CZ20 → CZ2000
* `puma20_to_cz90_popgrid100m_area.csv` – PUMA2020 → CZ90
* `puma20_to_cz20_popgrid100m_area.csv` – PUMA2020 → CZ20
* `puma2010_to_cz20_popgrid100m_area.csv` – PUMA2010 → CZ20
* `cz20_grid_totals.csv` – CZ20 population totals
* `puma20_grid_totals.csv` – PUMA20 population totals

**Variables:**
Each crosswalk includes:

* `<FROM>`: Identifier for the source geography (either `CZ20` or `PUMA20`)
* `<FROM>_name`: Source geography name (if available)
* `<FROM>_total_pop`: Total source geography population (from 100m grid)
* `share_of_<FROM>`: Share of source population in the target geography (also named as `afactor`)
* `<TARGET>`: Target geography ID (e.g., `CZ90`, `PUMA2010`)
* `<TARGET>_name`: Target geography name (if available)
* `pop_overlap`: Population in overlapping grid cells
* `state`: State identifier
* Metadata: number of overlapping grid `cells`, `grid_res_m` (100), `crs_epsg` (5070), `method` (`building_footprint_area`)

**Geographic coverage:**
United States

**Temporal coverage:**
1990, 2000, 2010, 2020

**How to use:**

* **For CZ20-based crosswalks:** Reallocate CZ20 statistics into target geographies by weighting with `share_of_CZ20` and aggregating.
* **For PUMA20 → CZ90 crosswalk:** Reallocate PUMA2020 statistics into CZ90 using `share_of_PUMA20`.
* For rates/means, reallocate numerators and denominators separately, then recompute rates.
