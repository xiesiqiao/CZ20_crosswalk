# U.S. 100m Population Grid (2020)

This repository provides a **high-resolution (100m × 100m) population raster** for the United States, created from 2020 Decennial Census population counts and following the methodological framework of Zhang & Zhao (2020).
The grid serves as the foundation for generating fine-grained spatial crosswalks and supports a wide range of spatial analyses.

## Variables

Each raster cell contains:

| Variable   | Description                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Cell value | Population count in that 100m × 100m square |
| CRS        | EPSG:5070 (NAD83 / Conus Albers)            |
| Resolution | 100m × 100m grid cells                      |

## Methodology

1. **Source data**: 2020 Decennial Census population counts (U.S. Census Bureau).
2. **Disaggregation**: Counts distributed into 100m grid cells, producing a continuous, uniform surface.
3. **Projection**: Reprojected to EPSG:5070 for compatibility with regional analyses and overlay with census geography.
4. **Framework**: Approach inspired by Zhang & Zhao (2020) on fine-scale population datasets.

## Usage

* **Population-weighted crosswalks**: Use as the population surface to construct crosswalks between geographic units.
* **Spatial analysis**: Ideal for uniform population density studies and overlay with geographic boundaries.
* **Aggregation**: Flexible for aggregating to arbitrary units (states, commuting zones, counties, custom boundaries).
* **Clipping**: Can be subset by states, commuting zones, or other regions of interest.

✅ Do you want me to package this into a **ready-to-use `README.md` file** like I did for the crosswalks one?
